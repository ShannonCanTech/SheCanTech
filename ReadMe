I know alot of you were seeking to utilize the mousemove feature of the particle background. The files can be located within the shannonaddin file. Remember to include main.js and the parallax.js files.

For the animated header feature, jquery files can be located within plugins. 

Let me know if you have any questions on Bootstrap, UI/UX elements, and responsive design. CopePen.io is a great reference for locating open sources web designs, animations, and features.

Go for it and best of luck!

P.S. Don't forget the jquery.migrate.min and jquery.min files.
